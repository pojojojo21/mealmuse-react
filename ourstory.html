      <h1>Design Learnings: Navigating the Needs of Kitchen Users</h1>
      <p>In the exciting world of culinary exploration, we took on the challenge to develop a gamified app that would
        serve as a guide for home cooks eager to delve into the diverse realms of cooking, yet often lacking the
        motivation to start cooking. Our goals were clear: to delve deep into the hearts and minds of our users,
        decipher their desires and struggles, and sculpt an interface that would highlight their passion for culinary
        creativity. We received meaningful feedback, profound insights, and navigated through a noticeable set of design
        challenges. In the following sections, we delve into the depths of our design journey, sharing the lessons
        learned and the evolution of our design process in a tale of culinary discovery and innovation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="page">
      <h1>Understanding User Needs: Getting in the Shoes of Cooking Enthusiasts</h1>
      <p>Our evaluation of user needs started with an immersive exploration into the world of cooking enthusiasts—a
        diverse set of individuals yearning to break free from the shackles of routine recipes and embark on a culinary
        adventure. Through a combination of interviews, surveys, and repeated user testing, we sought to comprehend and
        sympathize with the desires and aspirations of our target audience:</p>
      <p2>
        "I adore cooking, yet I often find myself trapped in a cycle of repetition, relying on the same handful of
        recipes. I crave excitement and variety in my culinary endeavors." - Leah, 22
      </p2>
    </div>
    <div class="page">
      <p2>
        "When I cook for my friends, I strive to infuse meals with love and creativity. However, amidst the chaos of
        daily life, I often struggle to find the time and inspiration to explore new recipes." - Melina, 22
      </p2>
      <p>
        These distinctive narratives echoed a common yearning—a hunger for novelty, convenience, and enjoyment in their
        culinary journey. Considering these profound insights and other similar ones, we set a goal to craft an app that
        would serve as an inspiration and empowerment for cooking enthusiasts worldwide. Our main target audience was
        individuals who are seeking to get more involved in cooking and explore new recipes; these are busy folks who
        find themselves repeating the same recipes a lot or folks who need motivation to try out cooking more on their
        own rather than taking take-out.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="page">
      <p>
        Overall, the initial goal of the app was to allow users to explore new recipes, save the ones they like, connect
        with friends, and collect points based on their cooking progress. Here, you can see our low-fi
        prototypes: our three initial prototypes are on the left and our revised prototype is on the right.

      <h1>Creating and Improving Designs: Navigating Through Feedback</h1>
      <p>We used different versions of our design, like rough sketches, to guide us on our journey. These sketches were
        like maps helping us reach our final destination. But it was the thoughts and opinions from people using our app
        that really pushed us forward. They showed us where we were doing well and where we needed to make things
        better. By testing and checking our designs carefully, we found out what worked and what didn't. This helped us
        make small changes over time to make our app even better.</p>
      <p2>"Some parts of the first design make cooking fun and exciting, like a popular language app called Duolingo." -
        Thomas, 19, on our first low-fi design</p2>
    </div>
    <div class="page">
      <p2>"I wish I could scroll through a page in the interface to see all the dishes I have completed, and get back to
        them if I enjoyed cooking them!" - Rob, 22, on our second low-fi design</p2>
      <p>These helpful comments steered us in the right direction. They told us to make our app more fun to use, easier
        to understand, and to add more interactive parts. Every time we made a small change, we got closer to our goal
        of making an app that was clear, enjoyable, and simple to use. Our interviewees were busy students who often
        make the same dishes and want to cook more at home instead of ordering take-out. They liked that the colors were
        consistent and simple, and they liked our app's logo, "MealMuse". They also liked new features like searching
        for recipes by ingredient, earning points for cooking tasks, and having a page to see all the dishes they've
        made before. They thought the game-like parts of our design were fun, especially the weekly tasks and
        leaderboard, which motivated them to cook more.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="page">
      <h1>Facing Challenges and Overcoming Design Problems</h1>
      <p>We encountered obstacles like deciding how our app should look and work, figuring out how to check if tasks
        were really done, and picking the best colors to use. But every time we faced a problem, we learned something
        new. We learned how important it is to make sure everyone can use our app easily. We figured out ways to make
        sure people knew if they finished a task or not. And we discovered which colors made our app look the best.</p>
      <p2>"Making sure tasks are really done helps build trust and a sense of belonging among users." - Juan, 27, on our
        task completion checks</p2>
    </div>
    <div class="page">
      <p2>"The leaderboard adds excitement and makes me want to try more recipes to gain points!" - Cynthia, 57, on our
        leaderboard feature</p2>
      <p>These stories of challenges and victories showed us the way forward. They fueled our desire to make an app that
        not only met but exceeded people's expectations.</p>
      <div class="row_pics">
        <p style="padding: 0vh 10vw;">Let’s elaborate more on the aspect of our app that we reconsidered in multiple
          iterations, namely the color
          selection for our buttons, headers, footers, text, etc. To determine the best color palette, we developed 5
          interface variants (on Figma) after narrowing down from 8 options through a questionnaire. Each variant
          differed
          notably in color palette, with one variant featuring soothing tones and another variant opting for vibrant
          primary colors. Users tested these variants by performing tasks like navigating the homepage and completing
          weekly challenges. Our fourth variant ranked highest for its game-like appearance, while our fifth variant
          excelled in user interaction. Notably, Variant 5 struck a balance, garnering positive feedback for both
          game-likeness and user engagement. Following team discussion, we prioritized this well-balanced approach,
          aiming
          to optimize user experience by considering both elements. This iterative process allowed us to identify the
          most
          viable candidate for our app's interface, ensuring that our design resonates with users while offering an
          engaging and visually appealing experience.</p>
        <div class="img_row">
          <h3>Variant 1</h3>

          <h3>Variant 3</h3>

    <div class="page">
      <p>You can see that our final color palette has improved significantly compared to our first figma model (hi-fi)
        through this process of repeated re-evaluation:</p>

        <img src="Images/Final Design.png" alt="Final Design" width="600vw" />
      </div>
      <p>Another important aspect of MealMuse that was re-evaluated were the features relating to socializing (e.g.
        share options); we were encouraged by those who tested the interface (especially Prof. Head!) to focus more on
        our game-like aspects of our app, and avoid implementing affordances that relate to different purposes. The key
        recommendation was to set aside the collaboration features, such as the leaderboard, and instead focus on
        changing the incentive structure. They proposed emphasizing positive feedback, achievements, and streaks to
        motivate users, highlighting the importance of fostering a supportive and rewarding environment rather than
        relying on competition as a reward mechanism, because a lot of people don’t like competition. They appreciated
        the “dopamine effect” caused by seeing your points right; on that thread they suggested that we could also
        dedicate some time to enhancing aesthetics to further promote dopamine release and engagement (e.g. more pop
        ups).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="page2">
      <p>Thus, we focused our energy on enhancing the game and cooking feel, as well as our app aesthetics (how it
        feels) with the following changes being the most important:</p>
      <div class="row_forks">
        <img src="Images/Fork.png" alt="Home" width="60vw" />
        <p2>We changed our ’currency’ from coins to forks to allude more to the theme of
          cooking.
        </p2>
      </div>
      <div class="row_forks2">
        <img src="Images/Fork.png" alt="Home" width="60vw" />
        <p2>We chose a color palette that is vibrant, exciting, and resembles games (rather than a serious palette).
        </p2>
      </div>
      <div class="row_forks">
        <img src="Images/Fork.png" alt="Home" width="60vw" />
        <p2>We created individual icons for each of our dishes, ingredients, and cuisines that fit in a unified
          aesthetic.
        </p2>
      </div>
      <div class="row_forks2">
        <img src="Images/Fork.png" alt="Home" width="60vw" />
        <p2>We bettered the functionality of the search function, allowing users to search by 3 options: dish, included
          ingredients, and cuisine.
        </p2>
      </div>
      <div class="row_forks">
        <img src="Images/Fork.png" alt="Home" width="60vw" />
        <p2>We linked our 3 tasks in the main to take users straight to the search page, so that they can conveniently
          start searching for dishes/tasks in that topic.
        </p2>
      </div>
      <div class="row_forks2">
        <img src="Images/Fork.png" alt="Home" width="60vw" />
        <p2>We assigned different points for different dishes (tasks) based on the number of ingredients. This
          encourages users to take on a more difficult challenge for a greater reward.
        </p2>

      <h1>Learning from Experience: Setting a Course for Future Designs</h1>
      <p>Looking back on our journey, we learned many important lessons that will help us in our future design projects.
        We learned how important it is to listen to what people want and need. We realized that by making small changes
        over time, we can make big improvements. And most importantly, we understood that good design isn't just about
        how things look—it's about how they make people feel. After our final round of interviews with users as well as
        the feedback we received from our final presentations, we decided on some improvements we would like to make to
        the app, should we launch it in the market. We present these in the following paragraphs.</p>
      <p>Our task completion is based on an honor system, where no authority actually confirms that a user has actually
        completed a task. In fact, someone could just mark a task as completed without having done so. We came up with
        ideas to work around this issue: for better verification, and community spirit, a user could take a picture of
        completed task, which would be sent to another randomly-chosen user in the app to verify. People should also get
        bonus points for verifying other people’s dishes. Alternatively, every user could have the option to navigate to
        a pool of task images where they can verify other user’s images as valid (with upper daily/weekly limit).
        To-be-verified images would enter this pool in a FIFO order so that no one has to wait too long to have their
        task verified.</p>
      <p>Further improvements include having the Ingredients hyperlinked (e.g. on weekly task, in a dish description),
        giving the user the option to go to the search tool once they click on it; this action would take you to an
        ingredient search tool with the present ingredient inserted. Regarding the amelioration of our Completed Tasks
        page, we aspire that people can scroll to display completions with basic icons, with information about each
        completion, and each individual dish having the user’s picture. Lastly, we would like our search function to
        have an option to filter out common allergy-inducing ingredients, such as gluten, as well as to provide tasty
        alternatives to those.</p>
      <h1>Finishing Our Journey: Keeping Innovation at the Heart of Our Designs</h1>
      <p>Our journey may have come to an end, but our quest for making cooking more fun and exciting continues. With the
        lessons we've learned and the experiences we've gained, we're ready to embark on a new adventure in design—a
        journey fueled by empathy, creativity, and a passion for making people's lives better. As we set sail into
        uncharted waters, we carry with us the wisdom gained from our voyage, ready to inspire and delight users for
