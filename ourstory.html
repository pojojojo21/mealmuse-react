      <h1>Design Learnings: Navigating the Needs of Kitchen Users</h1>
      <p>In the exciting world of culinary exploration, we took on the challenge to develop a gamified app that would
        serve as a guide for home cooks eager to delve into the diverse realms of cooking, yet often lacking the
        motivation to start cooking. Our goals were clear: to delve deep into the hearts and minds of our users,
        decipher their desires and struggles, and sculpt an interface that would highlight their passion for culinary
        creativity. We received meaningful feedback, profound insights, and navigated through a noticeable set of design
        challenges. In the following sections, we delve into the depths of our design journey, sharing the lessons
        learned and the evolution of our design process in a tale of culinary discovery and innovation.</p>

      <h1>Understanding User Needs: Getting in the Shoes of Cooking Enthusiasts</h1>
      <p>Our evaluation of user needs started with an immersive exploration into the world of cooking enthusiasts—a
        diverse set of individuals yearning to break free from the shackles of routine recipes and embark on a culinary
        adventure. Through a combination of interviews, surveys, and repeated user testing, we sought to comprehend and
        sympathize with the desires and aspirations of our target audience:</p>
      <p2>
        "I adore cooking, yet I often find myself trapped in a cycle of repetition, relying on the same handful of
        recipes. I crave excitement and variety in my culinary endeavors." - Leah, 22
      </p2>

        "When I cook for my friends, I strive to infuse meals with love and creativity. However, amidst the chaos of
        daily life, I often struggle to find the time and inspiration to explore new recipes." - Melina, 22
      </p2>
      <p>
        These distinctive narratives echoed a common yearning—a hunger for novelty, convenience, and enjoyment in their
        culinary journey. Considering these profound insights and other similar ones, we set a goal to craft an app that
        would serve as an inspiration and empowerment for cooking enthusiasts worldwide.  Our main target audience was
        individuals who are seeking to get more involved in cooking and explore new recipes; these are busy folks who
        find themselves repeating the same recipes a lot or folks who need motivation to try out cooking more on their
        own rather than taking take-out.

        Overall, the initial goal of the app was to allow users to explore new recipes, save the ones they like, connect
        with friends, and collect points based on their cooking progress. Here, you can see two of our low-fi
        prototypes: one of our three initial prototypes is on the left and our revised prototype is on the right.
